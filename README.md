Zeus Only Mode creates a new gaming experience for those looking to ZAP their friends in multiplayer.

When enabled, this plugin strips players of their weapons, and only allows the Zeus to be used, 
as well as utility and knife.

To activate and deactivate the plugin, you must type css_zeus_mode 0 or 1 into the console.
Stripped loadouts are saved to an internal database, and are then restored upon disabling of the
plugin.
